WE DID IT GUYS!!! We're so proud of this episode and we're really really happy you finally get to see it! Most of this episode has been in the works for almost a year now, and some parts of it are as old as 2012.

Join Barf Bag, Gelatin, and the rest of Team Ice Cube as they venture into the unknown, never before seen location. And let's hope Rocky and the rest of Beep know what they're getting themselves into!

Voting ends when this video is 48 hours old.
